# Leaflet cluster map of talk locations

# Run this from the _talks/ directory, which contains .md files of all your
# talks. This scrapes the location YAML field from each .md file, geolocates it
# with geopy/Nominatim, and uses the getorg library to output data, HTML, and
# Javascript for a standalone cluster map. This is functionally the same as the
# #talkmap Jupyter notebook.

# modern Leaflet loaded in talkmap/map.html (markers silently failed to render).
# talkmap/map.html and talkmap/leaflet_dist/ are hand-maintained instead.
