excerpt: 'The k路p method is a successful approach to obtain band structure, optical and transport properties of semiconductors and it depends on external parameters that are obtained either from experiments, tight binding or ab initio calculations. Despite the widespread use of the k路p method, a systematic analysis of the stability and the accuracy of its parameters is not usual in the literature.'
