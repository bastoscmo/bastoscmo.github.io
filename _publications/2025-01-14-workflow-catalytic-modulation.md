excerpt: 'Gold-based (Au) nanostructures are efficient catalysts for CO oxidation, hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions, but stabilizing them on graphene (Gr) is challenging due to weak affinity. This study investigates forming metal alloys to enhance stability and catalytic performance of Au-based nanocatalysts.'
