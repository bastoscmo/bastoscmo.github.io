excerpt: 'We performed first-principles calculations combined with a statistical approach based on the generalized quasichemical approximation (GQCA) to study the polymorphic features of the $CsPb_{1-x}Sn_{x}I_{3}$ alloy. Our analysis explored the impact of these polymorphic features on electronic properties, statistical attributes, and thermodynamic stability.'
