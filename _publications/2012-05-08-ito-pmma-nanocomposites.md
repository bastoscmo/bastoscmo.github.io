excerpt: 'In this work, nanocomposite films of indium tin oxide (ITO) nanowires in a PMMA matrix were obtained by tape casting. The electrical, optical and morphological properties of films were studied as a function of the amount of wires inserted in the composite, and it was used 1, 2, 5, and 10 wt %.'
