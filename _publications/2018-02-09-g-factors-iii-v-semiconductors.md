title: "A comprehensive study of g-factors, elastic, structural and electronic properties of III-V semiconductors using hybrid-density functional theory"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2018-02-09-g-factors-iii-v-semiconductors
excerpt: 'The limitations of the theoretical approaches to yield accurate structural and electronic properties on an equal footing, is due to the unphysical self-interaction problem that mainly affects the band gap and spin-orbit splitting (SOC) in semiconductors.'
