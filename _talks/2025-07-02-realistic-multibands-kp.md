This presentation describes a framework combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) and k.p calculations.

The k.p method is an effective method that offers advantages over *ab initio* methods, such as a lower computational cost and the ability to calculate systems with a large number of atoms.

A new fitting method is proposed to extract k.p parameters directly from band-structure calculations. The talk also discusses the use of the hybrid-DFT functional ($HSE_{\alpha}$) to improve the precision of the parameters and the description of the band structure.

Application examples are shown for zincblende (GaAs) and wurtzite (InAs and InP) semiconductors.
